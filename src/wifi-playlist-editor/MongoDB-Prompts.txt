How can I write a CRUD class for a MongoDB connection in C#? The class should be generic so that any payloads can be managed with it. Add a null check to all methods with parameters in the class.
Also define a suitable payload class with a unique ID in C#. Use person data as an example.


What does a typical connection string in C# for MongoDB connection look like?
